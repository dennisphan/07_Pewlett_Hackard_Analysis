# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
This analysis summarized data from Pyber rides in multiple cities. The aim was to assess factors that affect Pyber rides. The result was to facilitate further decision-making. 

This project focuses following items:
 - **The data summary** summarized general information by areas.
 - **The total weekly fares by city type** presented the changes in weekly fares by city type

## Analysis

### The data summary
Based on the data summary, the total ride was highest in urban areas with 1625 rides, than lowered in suburban areas with 625 rides, and touched bottom with only 125 rides in rural areas. In correlation with total rides, the number of drivers was only 78 drivers in rural areas, 490 drivers in suburban areas, and 2405 drivers in urban areas. The total fare increases in the same order with $4,327.93 (rural), $19,356.33 (suburban), and $39,854.38 (urban). 
While the nubmer of drivers, total ride, and total fare were increaseing in the order of rural, suburban, and urban areas, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver went the opposite way. In specific, the average fare per ride and driver were highest in rural areas ($34.62 and $55.49), than lowered in subruban ($30.97 and $39.50), and reached the lowest in urban areas ($24.53 and $16.57).

### The total weekly fares by city type
Based on the graph of total weekly fare by city type, the market size of each city type varied significantly: smallest in rural areas and largest in urban cities. The fluctuations in each market correlated with the market size where the least fluctuation occured in rural and the highest fluctuation happened in urban citites. In all three areas, the best time for ride sharing was the end of February while the beginning of January and the end of April were the most quiet time, except for suburban areas when the demand for Pyber service was high at the end of April.

## Limit
 - The data was only from 1/1/2019 to 5/8/2019. It might not fully reflect the cycle of economic and daily activities of customers as well as drivers. 

## Conclusion
 - There was not enough demand in comparison with supply for Pyber services in urban cities where the number of drivers were higher than the total ride (2,405 drivers for 1,625 rides). Pyber should reduce budget and promotion for recruiting drivers and spend more on encouraging customers to use Pyber services. 
 - While the number of drivers were less than total ride and the average fare per ride and per driver were significantly higher in rural and suburban cities than in urban cities, it might hint that the demand was not fully fulfilled in these areas. Pyber should consider implementing a more advanced research about expanding its services in rural and suburban cities. 
 - The fluctuations in the weekly total fare should be looked closely to spot the reason. Was it because of weak demand or the decrease in supply? Was there unfulfilled demand in those periods? Was it the result of competitors' activities?
